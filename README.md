## Linear Regression to Predict

* The Vehicle length, weight, ground clearance, and intercept  provided a non-random amount of variance to mpg which means they have a significant affect on the mpg.
* The P value of 5.35 x 10^-11 is much smaller than the assumed significance level of 0.05%, so there is sufficient evidence to reject our null hypothesis, so the slope of our linear model is not 0.
* From our linear regression model, our R-squared value is about 0.71, so 71% of the variability of our dependent variable is explained using this linear model. Due  to the missing 29% of data that can affect mpg, this model may not be enough to predict mpg values to a very accurate degree.
